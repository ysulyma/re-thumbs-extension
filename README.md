# rp-thumb-capture
Plugin+browser extension for recording thumbnails in ractive-player.

Currently, this only supports Chrome.

# Usage

1. Enter your development domain in `extension/manifest.json`

1. Install the browser extension in Chrome by going to `chrome://extensions/`, enabling Developer mode, and using "Load unpacked".

1. Load the plugin onto `Player`:
```tsx
import ThumbCapture from "rp-thumb-capture";

const controls = (<>
  {Player.defaultControlsLeft}

  <div className="rp-controls-right">
    <ThumbCapture/>

    {Player.defaultControlsRight}
  </div>
</>);

<Player controls={controls} script={script}>
```

1. Click on the plugin icon first.

1. Click on the thumb icon, enter the Chrome extension ID into the textbox.
